This is a simple stateless web editor for p5.js sketches. It uses the monaco editor, which is the underlying editor for VSCode.

This project is heavily based on the [p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). It is a demonstration of the TypeScript language service in the monaco editor, and how it can be used to provide autocompletion and documentation for p5.js functions.
