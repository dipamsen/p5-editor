This is a simple stateless web editor for p5.js sketches. It uses the monaco editor, which is the underlying editor for VSCode.

This project is heavily based on the [p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). It is a demonstration of the TypeScript language service in the monaco editor, and how it can be used to provide autocompletion and documentation for p5.js functions.

Type completion and documentation is provided by [p5-types/p5.ts](https://github.com/p5-types/p5.ts).
